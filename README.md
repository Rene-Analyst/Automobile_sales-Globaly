Automobile Sales Data Analysis

Overview:

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on automobile sales in Europe, USA, and Australia. Leveraging SQL, I delved into a rich dataset to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends within the automotive industry.

Key Highlights:

Datasets Used: Utilized datasets encompassing a diverse range of automotive sales data across Europe, USA, and Australia. The dataset provided a wealth of information, including vehicle models, pricing, and regional variations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of sales and uncover correlations between different variables. This process laid the foundation for deeper insights and actionable findings.

Geographical Trends: Analyzed geographical trends to discern market preferences, regional variations in pricing, and popularity of specific vehicle types. This analysis sheds light on the unique dynamics of the automobile market in each region.

Insights for Stakeholders: Derived actionable insights relevant to stakeholders, including automakers, dealerships, and more. These insights can inform strategic decisions, marketing strategies, and regulatory considerations.

Technologies Used:

SQL: Employed SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data, enabling efficient and effective analysis of the large dataset.

Data Visualization: Utilized Tableau to present key findings in a clear and accessible manner, enhancing the interpretability of complex data patterns.

Future Work:

This project lays the groundwork for future analyses, such as predictive modeling, machine learning applications, and deeper dives into specific market segments.
